# Choose integration test boundaries

How should a team make this testing strategy decision?

## Answer guide

- Start from the production risk and choose a test boundary that proves the behavior without making feedback unnecessarily slow.
- Make dependencies, data ownership, and environment isolation explicit so results are reproducible and failures can be diagnosed.
- Treat test execution time and flake rate as product metrics; improve the signal before tightening a release gate.
- Review the strategy after escaped defects and architecture changes. More tests do not automatically improve confidence when the wrong boundary is exercised.
