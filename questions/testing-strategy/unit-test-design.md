# Design a focused unit test

How should a team make this testing strategy decision?

## Answer guide

- Define the behavior and risk being controlled, then choose the smallest test boundary that provides reliable evidence.
- Keep data, dependencies, and environment assumptions explicit so results are reproducible and failures can be diagnosed.
- Balance execution cost against feedback speed and release confidence; use the check alongside review and operational signals.
- Reassess the strategy after incidents and architecture changes because an unowned test can become a source of false confidence.
